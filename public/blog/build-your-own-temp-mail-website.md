Have you ever wondered how temporary email services work, or even thought about running your own? At [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email), we're passionate about making temporary email accessible and powerful. That's why we're excited to show you how you can leverage our open-source frontend and robust backend API to launch your very own temp mail website in just a few simple steps!

This guide is perfect for developers looking to understand the mechanics, hobbyists wanting a cool project, or anyone curious about the tech behind disposable email.

## What You'll Be Building

By following this tutorial, you'll deploy a fully functional temporary email website powered by:

*   **Our Open-Source Next.js Frontend:** A sleek, modern, and performant user interface available on GitHub at [DishIs/temp-mail](https://github.com/DishIs/temp-mail). It's built with Next.js and TypeScript, making it fast and developer-friendly.
*   **Our Temp-Mail Maildrop API:** A powerful and reliable backend API hosted on RapidAPI ([Temp-Mail Maildrop1](https://rapidapi.com/dishis-technologies-maildrop/api/temp-mail-maildrop1)) that handles the core email generation and retrieval logic.

Your users will be able to generate temporary email addresses, receive emails, and enjoy a clean, ad-free experience (just like on [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email)!).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1.  **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Essential for running a Next.js application. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Git:** For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **A RapidAPI Account:** To subscribe to our Temp-Mail Maildrop API and get your API key. Sign up at [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/).
4.  **(Optional but Recommended) A Custom Domain:** If you want to host your temp mail service on your own domain name.
5.  **A Code Editor:** Such as VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Launching Your Temp Mail Site

Let's get started!

### Step 1: Clone the Open-Source Frontend Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the `DishIs/temp-mail` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DishIs/temp-mail.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd temp-mail
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies using npm or yarn:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Configure Your RapidAPI Credentials

1.  **Subscribe to the API on RapidAPI:**
    *   Go to our [Temp-Mail Maildrop1 API page](https://rapidapi.com/dishis-technologies-maildrop/api/temp-mail-maildrop1) on RapidAPI.
    *   Click on the "Pricing" tab to choose a plan. We offer a **free tier that provides 151 requests per day**, which is perfect for testing and personal use! If you anticipate higher traffic, you can consider upgrading to a paid plan for more requests.
    *   Subscribe to your chosen plan.

2.  **Get Your RapidAPI Key and URL:**
    *   Once subscribed, navigate to the "Endpoints" tab on the API page.
    *   On the right-hand side, under "Code Snippets," you will find your `X-RapidAPI-Key` and the `X-RapidAPI-Host` (which is part of the URL you'll need). The base URL for API requests is also typically shown. For our API, the `RAPIDAPI_URL` will be the base endpoint like `https://temp-mail-maildrop1.p.rapidapi.com`.

3.  **Set Up Your Environment Variables:**
    *   In the root of your cloned `temp-mail` project, you'll find a file named `.env.example`.
    *   Rename this file to `.env` (remove the `.example` extension).
    *   Open the `.env` file in your code editor. It will look something like this:
        ```
        RAPIDAPI_URL=
        RAPIDAPI_KEY=
        ```
    *   Fill in your `RAPIDAPI_URL` and `RAPIDAPI_KEY` that you obtained from RapidAPI:
        ```
        RAPIDAPI_URL=https://temp-mail-maildrop1.p.rapidapi.com
        RAPIDAPI_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   Save the `.env` file. **Important:** This file contains sensitive keys, so ensure it's added to your `.gitignore` file (it usually is by default in Next.js projects) to prevent committing it to a public repository.

### Step 4: Run Your Temp Mail Website Locally

Now that everything is configured, you can run your Next.js application locally:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will typically start your development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this address in your web browser, and you should see your very own temp mail website up and running! Test it out by generating emails and sending messages to them.

### Step 5: (Optional) Deploy Your Website and Add a Custom Domain

Your application is now running locally on port 3000. To make it accessible to the world, you'll need to deploy it. There are many platforms for deploying Next.js applications, such as:

*   **Vercel (Recommended for Next.js):** Offers a fantastic free tier and seamless integration with Next.js.
*   **Netlify:** Another popular option with a good free tier.
*   **AWS Amplify, Google Cloud Run, Azure Static Web Apps:** For more cloud-native deployments.
*   **Your Own Server:** Using PM2 or Docker if you prefer self-hosting.

Once deployed, you can configure your DNS settings with your domain registrar to point your custom domain (e.g., `mytempmailservice.com`) to your deployed application. The specifics will vary depending on your hosting provider and domain registrar.

## Congratulations! You've Built Your Own Temp Mail Service!

You now have a fully functional temporary email website, powered by a robust open-source frontend and our reliable backend API. This setup not only gives you your own temp mail service but also serves as a fantastic learning experience and a base for further customization if you wish.

**Key Features of Your New Temp Mail Site (inherited from FreeCustom.Email's philosophy):**

*   **Custom Email Names:** Users can choose their own email prefixes.
*   **Multiple Domain Choices (if configured in API/Frontend):** Your users can pick from domains you make available.
*   **Clean, Ad-Free Interface:** Just like [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email)!
*   **Fast and Responsive:** Thanks to Next.js and our optimized API.

## Further Possibilities

*   **Customize the Frontend:** Since you have the source code, feel free to modify the branding, styling, or even add new features to the Next.js application.
*   **Contribute:** If you make improvements to the open-source frontend, consider contributing back to the [DishIs/temp-mail](https://github.com/DishIs/temp-mail) repository!
*   **Monitor API Usage:** Keep an eye on your API usage on RapidAPI, especially if you expect significant traffic.

We're excited to see what you build! Using our resources, creating a personalized temp mail service is now within everyone's reach.
