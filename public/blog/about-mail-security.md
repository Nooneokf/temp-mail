# Major Upgrade: Attachment Support & Enhanced Security Now Live on FreeCustom.Email, Powered by DITMail!

[Experience the New, More Powerful FreeCustom.Email ‚Üí](https://www.freecustom.email)

At DishIs Technology, we believe that powerful tools should constantly evolve. Today, we're thrilled to announce a significant backend upgrade to our beloved free temporary email service, [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email). We have integrated the core engine of our new professional email platform, **[DITMail](https://pro.freecustom.email)**, to supercharge every inbound email on our free service.

This upgrade brings two massive new features to your temporary email experience:
1.  **Full Attachment Visibility & Access:** You can now see and access attachments sent to your temp mail addresses.
2.  **Enhanced Security Scanning:** Every inbound email and its attachments are now scanned for potential threats.

Let's dive into what this means for you.

## The Old Challenge: Missing Attachments

Previously, while [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email) was excellent for receiving text-based emails, verification codes, and links, it did not process or display attachments. If someone sent you an email with an attached PDF, image, or document, you simply wouldn't see it. This limited the use cases for our service.

We knew this was a major feature our users wanted, but implementing it required a robust, secure, and scalable backend. That's where DITMail comes in.

## The DITMail Engine: Powering a Safer Experience

The technology we built for our professional-grade DITMail service‚Äîincluding its secure Haraka-based SMTP reception and GridFS (GFS) file handling‚Äîis now the backbone for all incoming mail on [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email).

### How It Works: The Journey of Your Inbound Email

When an email is sent to your temporary address (e.g., `mytempaddress@junkstopper.info`), it now goes through a much more sophisticated process:

1.  **Secure Reception (SMTP):** The DITMail engine receives the email on our secure mail servers.
2.  **Initial Security Scan:** The email headers and content are immediately scanned for common spam signatures and potential phishing indicators.
3.  **Attachment Processing & Scanning:**
    *   The system detects if the email contains any attachments.
    *   **This is the crucial new step:** Each attachment is separated from the email body and subjected to a security scan. This scan looks for known malware signatures, suspicious file types, and other potential threats.
    *   The goal is to identify and flag potentially harmful files before they are ever presented to you.
4.  **Secure Storage (Temporary):** Clean attachments are stored temporarily using our secure GridFS system, which is designed to handle files efficiently.
5.  **Display in Your Inbox:**
    *   When you view the email in your [FreeCustom.Email](https://www.freecustom.email) inbox, you will now see the email body as usual.
    *   **New Feature:** At the end of the message, you will see a new, dedicated "Attachments" section. Each attachment will be listed clearly by its filename and size.

This process ensures that you not only get access to your attachments but that you get them through a system designed with security as a primary focus.

## What This Upgrade Means for You: New Possibilities

This is more than just a technical update; it unlocks a whole new range of use cases for your temporary email.

| New Use Case | How It Works Now | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Receiving E-Tickets & QR Codes** | You can now use a temp mail to sign up for an event and receive your PDF ticket or QR code image directly in your disposable inbox. | Signing up for a local workshop or a one-time event without using your primary email. |
| **Getting Reports & Whitepapers** | Many industry reports are sent as PDF attachments. You can now download them directly from your temp mail inbox. | Accessing a gated marketing report without subscribing to a long-term newsletter. |
| **Receiving Small Project Files** | A colleague or client can send you a small design asset (like a logo image or a document) for quick review. | A freelance contact sends you a sample `.png` file for quick feedback. |
| **Confirmation with Attached Invoices** | Signing up for a free trial that provides an initial (zero-cost) invoice as a PDF for your records. | You can now see and save this confirmation document if needed. |

### How Attachments Appear in Your Inbox

We've designed the user interface to be simple and clear. When you open an email that contains attachments, you will see them listed at the bottom of the email content.

**Example View:**

> **Subject:** Your Event Ticket
>
> Hello,
>
> Thank you for registering for our event! Your ticket is attached.
>
> ---
>
> **Attachments:**
>
> üìÑ `EventTicket_QR.pdf` (128 KB) - [Download]
>
> üñºÔ∏è `EventBanner.png` (256 KB) - [Download] [Preview]

*(This is an illustrative example of the UI)*

You'll be able to download the files directly. For common image types, we may also offer a safe, in-browser preview.
