# Introducing DITMail: Professional Email on Your Domain, Redefined & Radically Affordable

![Inbox demo](https://freeimghost.vercel.app/i/BHtwqzkh/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-1-10-06-AM-png.png)

[Check out the DITMail Demo at pro.tempmail.encorebot.me →](https://pro.tempmail.encorebot.me)

For years, [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) has served millions of users with a simple, powerful promise: a fast, free, and ad-free temporary email service. It was designed for privacy, convenience, and disposability. But as we spoke with our users—developers, freelancers, and small business owners—we heard a recurring need for something more. A need for the same simplicity and control, but with the permanence, professionalism, and power of a full-fledged email hosting service.

Today, we are thrilled to officially launch **DITMail**, the professional-grade evolution of our email philosophy, now live at **[pro.tempmail.encorebot.me](https://pro.tempmail.encorebot.me)**.

While `tempmail.encorebot.me` is your go-to for temporary, disposable email, **DITMail** is here to supercharge your own domain with professional-grade email delivery, robust security, and a suite of modern features—all at a fraction of the cost of competitors like Zoho, Google Workspace, or Proton Mail.

## What is DITMail? The Tech Behind Your New Inbox

DITMail is not just a reskin of an existing service. It's a full-featured email platform we've built from the ground up to be secure, fast, and scalable. It's the culmination of our experience in email delivery and our vision for a more accessible, modern email hosting solution.

Here’s a look at the powerful technology stack that makes DITMail possible:

| Component                 | Technology Used                               | What It Means for You                                                                                             |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email Reception**       | **Haraka-based SMTP**                         | A highly performant, encrypted, and secure foundation for receiving your emails reliably.                         |
| **Email Storage**         | **WildDuck-based IMAP**                       | A modern, scalable, and robust storage system for your emails, ensuring compatibility with all email clients.      |
| **Webmail Experience**    | **Next.js Modern UI**                         | An ultra-smooth, fast, and intuitive webmail interface that feels like a native app, not a clunky web page.       |
| **Real-Time Backend**     | **Redis Events & MongoDB**                    | Your inbox updates in real-time. No need to hit "refresh"—new mail appears instantly, powered by a modern backend. |
| **Large File Handling**   | **GridFS (GFS) Attachment Support**           | Send and receive large attachments with ease. Our system is built to handle big files without choking.            |
| **Core Architecture**     | **Multi-Domain, Multi-User, Organization-Ready** | DITMail is designed to scale with you, from a single user on one domain to an entire organization with multiple domains. |

## What You Get with DITMail: Features That Empower

DITMail is packed with features designed for both individuals and teams who demand control and efficiency.

✅ **Own Domain Email:** The core promise. Bring your own domain (`yourname@yourcompany.com`) and get instant inbox and sending access.

✅ **Advanced Admin Tools:** A clean, powerful admin panel lets you manage users, roles, domains, and view logs with ease.

✅ **Full SMTP & IMAP Compatibility:** Connect DITMail to any device or email client you love—Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, mobile clients, and more. It just works.

✅ **One-Click Security Setup (DKIM, SPF, DMARC):** Email security is complex, so we simplified it. We provide you with the exact DNS records, and our system automatically validates them to ensure your emails are authenticated and land in the inbox, not the spam folder.

✅ **Real-Time Email View:** Experience a dynamic inbox where new mail appears instantly, thanks to our event-driven backend.

✅ **True Productivity Tools:** Go beyond basic email with powerful **drafting, searching, filtering, and tagging** capabilities built right into our modern webmail.

✅ **Built-In Developer Logs & Events:** For tech-savvy teams, DITMail provides transparent access to logs and events, so you can monitor email activity and debug issues quickly.
