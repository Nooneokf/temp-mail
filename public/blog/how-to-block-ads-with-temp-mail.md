Are you tired of being bombarded with ads and spam emails after connecting to public Wi-Fi networks? Many users don’t realize that providing their real email address for Wi-Fi access can lead to privacy issues, unwanted marketing, and targeted advertising. In this guide, you’ll learn how to block ads and protect your privacy by using an **anonymous email** or **temporary email** (temp mail) from [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) when registering for public Wi-Fi.

## Why Do Public Wi-Fi Networks Show So Many Ads?

Public Wi-Fi is available in cafes, airports, hotels, libraries, and other public spaces. To access these networks, users are often required to sign up with an email address. This process is not just about granting access—it’s also a way for Wi-Fi providers and their partners to collect your data for marketing and advertising purposes.

### Common Reasons Wi-Fi Providers Collect Your Email:

1.  **Building Marketing Lists:** Your email is added to databases for sending promotional offers, newsletters, and advertisements.
2.  **User Tracking:** Your email can be linked with other data to track your visits and preferences, enabling targeted advertising.
3.  **Data Monetization:** Your personal information, including your email, is often exchanged for free Wi-Fi access.

As a result, your inbox may fill up with spam, and you may notice more personalized ads based on your Wi-Fi usage.
