# The Next Evolution of Temp Mail: Introducing Pro Plans, Custom Domains, and Permanent Storage!

[Explore the New Tiers of Temp Mail →](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me)

Temporary email was born out of a simple need: to get a quick, disposable address to avoid spam. For years, [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) has perfected that experience, offering the fastest, ad-free anonymous temp mail service. But what if a temporary email could be more? What if it could be a powerful tool for developers, a flexible asset for businesses, and a more robust utility for power users?

Today, we're excited to announce the single biggest evolution in our platform's history. We are introducing **three distinct tiers of service**, powered by our secure identity provider, [whatsyour.info (WYI)](https://whatsyour.info). This upgrade transforms tempmail.encorebot.me from a simple utility into a full-fledged, scalable email platform, offering everything from anonymous inboxes to **temp mail with custom domains** and **permanent cloud storage**.

## From One-Size-Fits-All to a Tailored Experience

The classic temp mail experience isn't going anywhere. Our commitment to a fast, free, no-login-required service is stronger than ever. However, we recognized that different users have different needs. A developer testing an application has different requirements than someone signing up for a one-time newsletter.

This new structure allows us to serve everyone better:

### 1. Anonymous Guest: The Classic, Reimagined
This is the tempmail.encorebot.me you know and love, but better. It's perfect for quick, one-off tasks where anonymity is key.
*   **Instant Access:** No login, no registration. Just land on the page and go.
*   **Email History:** The 5 most recent emails are kept for each mailbox.
*   **12-Hour Storage:** Emails are automatically and permanently purged after 12 hours.
*   **No Attachments:** For maximum speed and security, attachments are not processed. You'll be notified if an email contains one.

### 2. WYI Free User: More Power, Still Free
By logging in with your free [whatsyour.info](https://whatsyour.info) account, you unlock a new level of functionality designed for regular use.
*   **1MB Attachment Support:** Receive small files, QR codes, and documents.
*   **Customizable Inboxes:** You can now edit your email address prefix.
*   **Expanded History:** Your inbox now holds up to 10 emails.
*   **Save Emails to Browser:** A crucial feature! You can now choose to save important emails directly to your browser's local storage, keeping them safe before they auto-delete from our servers.
*   **24-Hour Storage:** The auto-deletion window is extended to a full day.
*   **Basic Keyboard Shortcuts:** Navigate your inbox faster.

### 3. WYI Pro: The Ultimate Temp Mail for Business & Developers
This is the game-changer. For a small subscription fee, WYI Pro users get a suite of features that transforms temporary email into a professional tool. This is the **temp mail pro** solution you've been waiting for.

*   **Use Your Own Custom Domains:** This is our most requested feature. You can now use tempmail.encorebot.me's powerful engine with your own domain. Receive emails at addresses like `qa-testing@your-company.com` or `project-alpha@your-business.com`. Full MX and TXT verification support is included.
*   **5GB Permanent Cloud Storage:** Say goodbye to auto-deletion. Your emails are saved to your private, secure 5GB cloud storage on our MongoDB cluster. They are only deleted when you choose to delete them.
*   **25MB Attachment Limit:** Powered by GridFS, you can now receive large files, reports, and assets, making this a viable tool for professional collaboration.
*   **Full API & Embedding:** Embed a full-featured inbox directly into your website or application. Perfect for dev environments, internal tools, or customer support platforms.
*   **Mute Senders:** Block spammy or unwanted senders from reaching your inboxes.
*   **No Interruptions:** Enjoy a completely clean, ad-free, and popup-free experience.

## Spotlight: Why Temp Mail Pro is a Game-Changer

The introduction of our Pro plan addresses key limitations of traditional disposable email services.

| Pro Feature | The Impact for Your Business or Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Custom Domains** | **Enhances brand professionalism and trust.** Instead of using a public domain, your QA teams can test user signups with emails that reflect your own brand, making it a true **temp mail for business** solution. |
| **Permanent Storage** | **Creates a reliable, long-term testing asset.** You can build a persistent library of test emails and user accounts without fear of them being deleted. It bridges the gap between temporary and permanent email. |
| **Large Attachments** | **Unlocks real-world use cases.** Your temp inboxes can now receive project files, detailed PDF reports, and high-resolution assets, making it useful for client feedback loops and internal reviews. |
| **Full Embedding** | **Integrates seamlessly into your workflow.** Developers no longer need to leave their application to check a test email. The inbox comes to them, dramatically speeding up development and testing cycles. |
