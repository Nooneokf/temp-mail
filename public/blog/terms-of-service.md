## Our Core Principle: Use Temp Mail Wisely and Legally

Temporary email is a fantastic tool for enhancing online privacy and convenience. However, like any tool, it can be misused. Our primary expectation is that you will use [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) in a manner that is:

*   **Lawful:** You agree not to use our service for any illegal activities. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, harassment, distributing malicious software, phishing, impersonation for unlawful purposes, or violating any applicable local, national, or international laws.
*   **Respectful:** Do not use our service to send spam, unsolicited bulk messages, or engage in abusive behavior towards others.
*   **Ethical:** Use [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) for its intended purposes – such as protecting your primary inbox from spam, testing services, or one-time verifications. Do not use it to circumvent legitimate security measures, abuse free trial offers in a way that violates other services' terms, or engage in deceptive practices.

## Understanding the Nature of Our Service

When you use [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me), it's important to remember:

1.  **Temporary and Disposable:** Our service provides temporary, disposable email addresses. Emails and addresses are not intended for long-term storage or critical communications. We are not responsible for any loss of data or access resulting from the ephemeral nature of the service.
2.  **No Expectation of Permanent Access:** While we provide features like saving your previously used 5 emails for convenience, this does not guarantee permanent access to any specific email address or its contents.
3.  **Public Nature (Potentially):** While you can "put any email name," and our system strives to provide unique inboxes for active sessions, the fundamental design of many temp mail services means there's no inherent security for the *content* of emails received. Do not send or receive sensitive personal information (passwords, financial details, etc.) through our service. Treat messages as potentially viewable if an address were to be re-used or accessed by others after your session.
4.  **No Account Creation:** You use [tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) without creating a formal account with a password. This is part of its convenience but also underscores its temporary nature.

## Prohibited Activities

To maintain the integrity and legality of our platform, the following activities are strictly prohibited:

*   **Illegal Use:** Any activity that violates local, state, national, or international law.
*   **Spamming:** Sending unsolicited bulk email or commercial messages.
*   **Phishing and Malware:** Attempting to deceive others to obtain sensitive information or distributing harmful software.
*   **Harassment and Abuse:** Using the service to threaten, stalk, defame, or otherwise harass individuals.
*   **Impersonation:** Falsely representing yourself as another person or entity for malicious purposes.
*   **Automated Abuse:** Using bots or scripts to excessively overload our systems or abuse the service in a way not intended by its design (e.g., mass creation of addresses for malicious campaigns).
*   **Circumventing Security:** Attempting to bypass security measures of our service or any other service using our temp mail.
*   **Resale or Unauthorized Commercial Use:** Our service is for personal, non-commercial use unless explicitly authorized by us.

## Our Right to Moderate and Terminate Use

[tempmail.encorebot.me](https://www.tempmail.encorebot.me) reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to:

*   Monitor usage to ensure compliance with our terms.
*   Block access from certain IP addresses or ranges if abuse is detected.
*   Remove or block access to email addresses found to be involved in prohibited activities.
*   Terminate or suspend access to our service for users who violate these terms, without prior notice.

We do this to protect our platform, our users, and the broader internet community.
